Nobunaga is regarded as one of three unifiers of Japan along with his retainers Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu. Nobunaga was widely known as one of the most brutal figures in history, eliminating anyone who stood in his way. He was both a skilled ruler and keen businessman, strategizing at both the micro- and macroeconomic scales. He met his demise when his retainer Akechi Mitsuhide rebelled against him at Honn\u014d-ji."},{"id":"4","title":"\u5c71\u672c\u4e94\u5341\u516d","content":"\u5c71\u672c \u4e94\u5341\u516d\uff08\u3084\u307e\u3082\u3068 \u3044\u305d\u308d\u304f\u30011884\u5e74\uff08\u660e\u6cbb17\u5e74\uff094\u67084\u65e5 - 1943\u5e74\uff08\u662d\u548c18\u5e74\uff094\u670818\u65e5\uff09\u306f\u3001\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u6d77\u8ecd\u8ecd\u4eba\u3002\u7b2c26\u300127\u4ee3\u9023\u5408\u8266\u968a\u53f8\u4ee4\u9577\u5b98\u3002\u6d77\u8ecd\u5175\u5b66\u682132\u671f\u751f\u3002\u6700\u7d42\u968e\u7d1a\u306f\u5143\u5e25\u6d77\u8ecd\u5927\u5c06\u3002\u524d\u7dda\u8996\u5bdf\u306e\u969b\u3001\u30d6\u30fc\u30b2\u30f3\u30d3\u30eb\u5cf6\u4e0a\u7a7a\u3067\u6226\u6b7b\uff08\u6d77\u8ecd\u7532\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff09\u3002\u65e7\u59d3\u306f\u9ad8\u91ce\u3002"},{"id":"5","title":"This is not what you're looking for...","content":"Not this post...
